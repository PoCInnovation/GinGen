# GinGen

Nowadays, in order to make developers' tasks easier, numerous tools of all kinds have been invented. This is particularly true for anything related to code documentation, as it is a crucial part for ensuring that every team member can quickly understand how each part works.

Regarding APIs, a documentation system called [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) has been implemented to facilitate the understanding of each endpoint and their different bodies and responses. But in order to generate this documentation, Swagger requires a JSON document with different fields to correctly transcribe the information, known as an [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).
This specification is integrated in a whole ecosystem of tools available to create tests, stubs and simplify development processes ‚öôÔ∏è

To generate this JSON specification, many people would find it simpler and more natural to simply document each function directly in the code, so that it can be used to create a specification incrementally and simplify its maintenance. 

This is where the idea for **GinGen** came about, an program that allows for a specific documentation present in a **Go code** to be transcribed into a valid OpenAPI v3 specification that can be used with the tools provided by Swagger and the OpenAPI community üöÄ

## How does it work?

This project focuses on two important parts of an API:
- **Endpoints**, which are the different triggers that are called when a specific URL is executed.
- **Handlers**, which are the methods called following the call of an endpoint.

Therefore, there are two types of documentation to look for.

For now, we are parsing only one file at a time, but we plan to dive deeper by allowing the program to be launched at the root of an API in order to retrieve each part of the documentation.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository and simply execute:
```sh
make
```

to build the `GinGen` executable.

### Usage

To run the program, two arguments are required:
- the file to parse
- the JSON file in which to write the result.

```sh
./GinGen -i main.go -o doc.json

# Alternative option with the full flags
./GinGen --input main.go --output doc.json
```

You can also specify a JSON file containing components to be added to the generated specification using the `-c` or `--component` flag.
